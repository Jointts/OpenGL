How to make model compliant with the engine:

1) Make sure when exporting as .FBX you have a bitmap as your material texture not a combined node.
2) Go to the settings(wrench) tab and press Reset Xform (will fix pivot)
3) Go to Scripting -> Run Script... and run the YUP_tool (last time it was in your res folder) or else it will export with the wrong UP coordinate(Z)

Youre good to go :)
